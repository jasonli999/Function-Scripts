# Function-Scripts
As a personal project, I created some scripts that showed graphical representations of Calculus I (2D Function Script) and III (3D Function Script) concepts. 
I later used the project to help others learn calculus. 
This was my first coding project and so the documentation is lacking. 
Scripts are meant to run in JupyterNotebook so that graphs can be interactive, especially the Calculus III script. 
A Calculus II script is likely in progress.
